# Conclusion

This coursework applied various NLP techniques to analyze the IMDB dataset. Sentiment 
analysis using VADER and TextBlob revealed a sentiment distribution of 58.9% positive, 31.3% 
negative, and 9.8% neutral, showing consistent outputs between the methods. Topic modeling 
with LDA, enhanced by bigram generation, identified 10 coherent topics, such as relationships, 
action, and production, achieving a coherence score of 0.411. Stylometric analysis utilized TF
IDF, PCA, and KMeans clustering, supported by hierarchical clustering, to identify 3 distinct 
clusters with top terms reflecting stylistic variations in the reviews. Effective preprocessing, clear 
visualization, and thorough evaluation ensured meaningful insights from the dataset.
